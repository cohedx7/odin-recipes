Project: Recipes from TOP Foundations

Well, this was an interesting exercise! I had a lot of fun
building a basic website project from scratch and learned
quite a bunch of things. It seems like time flied while I was doing this.

Getting to practice what I learned over the past few days 
was sort of an eye-opener to me.

Looking forward to seeing what else this path has in 
store for me!
