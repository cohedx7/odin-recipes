        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>Tamago egg is a classic <strong><em>Japanese</em></strong> folded omelet
        sometimes called tamagoyaki. <br> The omelet is sweet,
        has a light texture, and works well when served
        over sushi rice and with soy and wasabi sauce 
        for dipping.</p>
        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>4 eggs</li>
            <li>1/4 cup prepared dashi stock</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon white sugar</li>
            <li>1 teaspon mirin (Japanese sweet wine)</li>
            <li>1/2 teaspoon soy sauce</li>
            <li>1/2 teaspoon vegetable oil (or more as needed)</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Beat eggs thoroughly in a bowl; whisk in dashi stock, 
            sugar, mirin, and soy sauce until sugar has dissolved.</li>
            <li>Place a nonstick skillet or omelet pan over medium 
            heat. Oil the pan with vegetable oil. Pour a thin layer 
            of egg mixture into the hot pan and swirl to coat pan.</li>
            <li>When egg layer is firm on the bottom but still 
            slightly liquid on top, lift up about 1 inch of the edge 
            of the omelet with a spatula and fold end over remaining 
            egg layer; continue rolling the omelet to the end and 
            push the roll to the edge of the skillet. Oil the skillet 
            again if it looks dry; pour another thin layer of egg 
            into the skillet and lift the roll to let the egg flow 
            underneath the omelet roll. Fold the omelet roll over 
            the new layer of egg, continuing to roll to the end as 
            before. Push omelet to edge of skillet.</li>
            <li>Pour a new egg layer into the skillet, oiling the 
            pan if needed. Roll the omelet over to incorporate the 
            next egg layer into the roll. Pour new layers and roll 
            into the omelet until all egg mixture has been used. 
            Remove omelet to a serving platter and cut into 6 equal 
            pieces to serve.</li>
        </ol>
